      <description>&lt;p&gt;The formatting of a report can depend on the specific requirements of your organization or educational institution. However, here are the main elements that are usually included in a report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title Page: This includes the report title, your name (or organization name), date, and possibly the report version number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract (Summary): A brief description of the report&amp;rsquo;s objectives, methodology, main findings, and conclusions. This is usually written after the title page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction: An overview of the report&amp;rsquo;s objectives, tasks, significance, and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main Body: Contains the main information, results, and analysis of your work. This may include sections dedicated to methodology, research, data analysis, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Summarizes your findings, draws conclusions, and may offer recommendations based on the results obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;References (or Sources): Lists all the sources of information you have used, cited, or referred to in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendices: If the report contains additional materials such as tables, graphs, program code, etc., they can be included in the appendices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to adhere to a consistent style and formatting throughout the report, as well as pay attention to the correctness of formatting tables, graphs, and citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown Markup Languange</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/blog-with-jupyter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/blog-with-jupyter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to create formatted documents. It is commonly used for formatting readme files, documentation, messages in online forums, and is supported by many platforms and tools, such as GitHub, Reddit, and various content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is designed to be easy to read and write in plain text, but at the same time, it can be converted into HTML for online display. It uses simple symbols and conventions to indicate various text formatting elements such as headings, bold and italic text, lists, links, and images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common elements in Markdown syntax include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; for headers (e.g., # Heading 1, ## Heading 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;*&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;_&amp;rsquo; for emphasis (e.g., &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists using &amp;lsquo;*&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;-&amp;rsquo; for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links (&lt;a href=&#34;url&#34;&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;) and images (















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;url&#34; alt=&#34;Alt Text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
) formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockquotes using &amp;lsquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo; symbol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code blocks using backticks (`)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown provides a convenient way to format text without the need for complex HTML coding, making it popular for quick and efficient document creation, especially for creating content for the web that requires basic formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The last week of march</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/post2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/post2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My week was not all that, it was I can say a calm week. Off course, me being a student,I had to attend all my classes and complete all my assignments.This past week I only went to work twice, that&amp;rsquo;s yesterday and today. I thought balancing work and studies will be a piece of cake but it&amp;rsquo;s actually exhausting and no longer fun. The positive thing is that you gain alot of skills while working that they don&amp;rsquo;t teach everything in school such as time management and other important skills that will help you later in life. You can say my week was pretty boring, nothing fun happened. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a quite full schedule this past week. I made sure to attend all my classes, complete all my assignments and put in effort to study, staying true to my academic goals.It was also an exciting time because I had my first day working at KFC, stepping into a new role and starting a fresh journey in the workforce. Balancing work and studies, I managed to squeeze in a visit to the Red Square, adding a touch of exploration to my busy week. Overall, it was a week of learning, working and a bit of adventure, a mix that keeps life interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Version Control System(VCS)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/version-managementgit/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/version-managementgit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-version-control&#34;&gt;About Version Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-how-git-a-popular-version-control-system-works&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how Git, a popular version control system, works:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository: Git operates within a repository, a directory where all the files and historical data for the project are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commits: Developers make changes to files in the repository and create commits to save these changes. Each commit has a unique identifier, a timestamp, and the author&amp;rsquo;s information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branching: Git allows for branching, enabling developers to work on different features or fixes independently. Branches are separate lines of development that can be merged back together later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merging: When a feature is ready, developers merge the changes from one branch (e.g., a feature branch) back into another (e.g., the main branch) to integrate the new code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote Repositories: Git also supports remote repositories, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project and synchronize their changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict Resolution: If two developers make conflicting changes to the same file, Git helps in resolving these conflicts by highlighting the differences and requiring manual intervention to decide how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, version control systems like Git provide a structured way to manage code changes, collaborate efficiently, maintain a history of modifications, and ensure project integrity in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;charts&#34;&gt;Charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; format for interactive charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example &lt;code&gt;line-chart.json&lt;/code&gt;, and then add the &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; chart data=&amp;quot;line-chart&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;div id=&#34;chart-813562974&#34; class=&#34;chart&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  (function() {
    let a = setInterval( function() {
      if ( typeof window.Plotly === &#39;undefined&#39; ) {
        return;
      }
      clearInterval( a );

      Plotly.d3.json(&#34;./line-chart.json&#34;, function(chart) {
        Plotly.plot(&#39;chart-813562974&#39;, chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true});
      });
    }, 500 );
  })();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly JSON Editor&lt;/a&gt; useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34; data-lang=&#34;latex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;callouts&#34;&gt;Callouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic supports a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.hugoblox.com/content/writing-markdown-latex/#callouts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;shortcode for callouts&lt;/a&gt;, also referred to as &lt;em&gt;asides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hints&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;alerts&lt;/em&gt;. By wrapping a paragraph in &lt;code&gt;{{% callout note %}} ... {{% /callout %}}&lt;/code&gt;, it will render as an aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% callout note %}}
